[one-on-one.tech](https://one-on-one.tech/) is one of my side project. It’s a website which helps professionals to improve business networking by having one-on-one meetings with other professionals who match their interests.

:warning: The project is abandoned and not live anymore from November 2022.


# How it started
At the beginning of 2020 during the start of covid I had some free time as our company was closed for a few weeks. I used the time to deepen my skills in Django & Frontend Development. At the end of the Udemy course there was a capstone project. Only following this project was a bit boring to me so I started my own project. 

# Problem:
I hate the traditional way of networking and I bet many of you too. Too often I found myself in networking situations with other people but couldn't get much value out of it. After thinking about it for quite some time I ended up with 3 reasons:
Lack of common interests: Working as a technical person in a business department I usually have a counterpart who has completely different interests than me. Even though it is still nice to learn about other topics I couldn’t expand my network with people where I could benefit from (and the other way around).
Approaching people can be awkward: This counts for real life situations as well for online situations. Do people actively network via Linkedin?
Networking in groups: Often when I was in a networking situation, I was in a medium sized group of people with extremely unpersonal conversations. 

# Solution:
I actually started this project as a capstone project for learning purposes after a django course with no intention to build a real product. That's the way it is when you are bored during the pandemic so one year later I have the first working product ready which aims to solve the problems stated above. 
My website allows you to create so called “one-on-one” meetings. These one-on-ones are always related to specific topics so people get to meet like minded counterparts. Other users can then reach out to the one-on-one creator in order to organize a conversation like a virtual/ real coffee. No AI involved which creates matches for you. You decide.
My main goal is to bring together the right people and raise the quality of networking.

# Technical Implementation:
I use Django as my Backend with a PostgreSQL hosted on Heroku. On the Frontend I use HTML, CSS and Javascript (Vanilla & Jquery). I implemented a very basic Service Worker in order to provide a PWA.
For the video chatting I used Jitsi.

# Deployment:
I knew from the beginning that this needs to be a B2B project and not a B2C. The idea was to implement this as a SaaS in multiple companies. I spent a lot of time in building the product (it was my first Django project so it took me some time to build and learn on the fly). After a first working product was ready, I thought about the distribution process. For me the most important thing is to find a company who is willing to just try it out together with me. Very fast I learned the hard way that implementing something in a company is not that easy as it sounds. You have to follow a lot of rules and processes before this can be deployed. 
My first intention was to try it out in my own company at Mercedes-Benz as I have good contacts and it is just easier to get to the right people if you are already in the company. I reached out to several people and got very good response. The Management was committed to try it out. With the backup of the Management, I was super enthusiastic but very soon legal & compliance brought me back to reality. All in all it would be a very complex and lengthy (>1 year) process to just even try the product out because of all the rules and regulations. Of course, this was not my intention so together with my counterpart we decided to stop it.
After that I tried my luck with “cold outreach” and had a few conversations. One was already quite promising but ended also without further collaboration.

# Lessons Learned:
Even though the project turned out with no success I learned so much out of it. I really made a big step in programming & web development. I learned so much about how to present a product and “sell” it to other people. All in all I learned a lot of things which I would not do the same again.
